Restore this old printed photo to brand new condition. 
Remove all scratches, fading, dust, spots, noise, and any 
yellow/brown aging cast. Remove all light reflections, 
flash glare, glossy shine, and moiré patterns since this 
is a picture taken of a physical print. Correct any blur, 
softness, or out-of-focus areas caused by the paper being 
curved or poor photographing angle — make the entire image 
uniformly sharp from corner to corner. Sharpen details gently 
and naturally, enhance contrast, and upscale to high resolution. 
If the photo is black-and-white, restore clean neutral tones 
with deep blacks, bright whites, and rich grayscale — keep it 
strictly monochrome, no colorization. If the photo is originally 
in color, bring back accurate, vibrant yet natural original colors 
without over-saturation. Preserve the authentic vintage feel of the 
era, nothing overly modern or artificial.
